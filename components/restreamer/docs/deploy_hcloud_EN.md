How to deploy Ephyr re-streamer to Hetzner Cloud
================================================

This guide provides a common and recommended way to deploy Ephyr re-streamer application as a standalone server on [Hetzner Cloud].




## 0. Prerequisites 

You should have a registered account on [Hetzner Cloud] with a [payment method attached to it][1].

Also, you should have a created [Project] in it. If you don't have one, just create it via `+ NEW PROJECT` button on [Projects page][Project].

## 1. Create server

Open the page of new server creation in your [Project].


### 1.1. Choose a location

Consider the location, which is the closest both to source endpoints (where the RTMP stream origin goes from) and destination endpoints (where the RTMP stream is re-streamed to).

### 1.2. Choose Ubuntu 20.04 image

> __WARNING__: Other images are not supported! Do NOT select them!


### 1.3. Choose desired resources

For simple re-streaming the cheapest one should be enough. But if you're going to run a very large amount of re-streams, consider a more performant variant.

### 1.4. Attach volume (optional)

> __NOTE__: Skip this step if you're not going to do recording into files.

If you're going to record live streams into files you may need a larger disk size than the one provided by default on the server. This can be fulfilled by creating and attaching an external volume to the created server.

Provision script will automatically detect and use it for Ephyr re-streamer.


### 1.5. Inject provision script

To install Ephyr re-streamer onto a newly created server, we should specify a provision script for doing that installation job.

Paste the text below to the `User data` section.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
curl -sL https://tinyurl.com/mtfwurr4 | EPHYR_VER=0.2.0 bash -s
```

### 1.6. Setup SSH access

[Hetzner Cloud] requires the created server to be accessible via [SSH], thought it's not required for using Ephyr re-streamer.

If you don't have [SSH] key, you may quickly generate a new pair of keys [on this page][2]. You will need to specify a __public key__ to [Hetzner Cloud].

### 1.7. Provide server's name

Specify a custom name of the server to not forget its purpose, or just go with a default one if you don't bother about it.

### 1.8. Proceed with a server creation

Do not use backups or volumes. They are redundant as Ephyr re-streamer doesn't store any data.

## 2. Access Ephyr re-streamer

After you've launched a server creation, wait from 5 to 15 minutes until it is provisioned and Ephyr re-streamer is installed.

![Server IP](images/hcloud_2.jpg)

Use IP address of the created server in browser's address bar to access the installed Ephyr re-streamer (Web UI may look a bit different from the picture below).

> __WARNING__: Do NOT use `https://` scheme in browser's address. ONLY `http://` is supported.
